## What is Prometheus?

Prometheus transforms every connected device into a sensor in a global threat detection swarm — without central control, without a foundation, without hidden interests. It combines on-device AI (Phi-3-mini) with LLaMA 3 guardian nodes and Kaspa L1 consensus to create an incorruptible, zero-pre-mine security protocol.

## Quick Start

| Node Type | Hardware | Command |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Light Client** | Any device, 4 GB RAM | `cargo run -p prometheus-client` |
| **Validator** | Kaspa node + 10,000 KAS stake | `cargo run -p prometheus-validator` |
| **Guardian (8B)** | RTX 4070 Ti+, 16 GB VRAM | `cd modules/guardian-node && docker compose up guardian-8b` |
| **Guardian (70B)** | 4x A100/H100, 128 GB RAM | Uncomment `guardian-70b` in docker-compose.yml |

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NeaBouli/prometheus-.git
cd prometheus-
cargo build --release
```

## Architecture

```
Layer 1 (Kaspa L1):  ValidatorStaking | GuardianReputation | RuleStorage | GovernanceAutoTuning
                     Silverscript contracts on Kaspa with DAGKnight consensus (100 BPS)

Layer 2 (P2P):       Threat hints | YARA rule proposals | Commit-Reveal voting | ZK proofs
                     Decentralized coordination between clients, guardians, and validators

Off-Chain:           Phi-3-mini (local AI) | LLaMA 3 (guardian AI) | Fed-DART (federated learning)
                     Privacy-preserving — raw data never leaves the device
```

---

## Tokens

| Token | Role | Details |
|-------|------|---------|
| **KAS** | Validator Staking | Kaspa native token. Validators stake KAS (min 10,000). Slashed on misbehavior. |
| **PROM** | Reputation & Governance | 0% pre-mine. Earned by guardians for accepted proposals. 20M annual emission. |

**Important:** Validators stake KAS, never PROM. PROM is earned through contribution, never purchased or staked.
